# Analysis of scheduling algorithms

We'll explore several scheduling algorithms in this analysis. But first, let's settle some terms.

## Terms

- User: Module that generates messages periodically;
- User count: The number of users
- Unlucky user: user which loses their connectivity (i.e. won't be able to forward its messages) for a certain period of time;
- Sink: Module which receives all the messages generated by the users;
- Scheduler: Module which controls how many messages a user will be able to forward to the sink in a scheduling cycle, given a specific scheduling algorithm;
- Scheduling algorithm: a plan which decides how many channels should be allocated to a user;
- Weights: An array of values which indicates how important are a user's packets;
- Channel count: A value showing how many channels can be distributed among users.

## Scheduling algorithms

- Dummy
- Weighted Round-Robin
- First come, first served
